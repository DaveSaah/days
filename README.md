## Why this program?

We live life too fast that we forget that time flies so quickly. In **Psalms 90:12**,
David wrote, "Teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom".
I hope this program brings you to a conciousness to slow down and enjoy every moment
and live a full filled life.
