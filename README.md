# Days

Check the number of days you've spent on earth.

## Usage

```console
# initialise with your date of birth

mydays init dd/mm/yyyy
```

```console
# check the number of days

mydays show
```

## Why this program?

We live life too fast that we forget that time flies so quickly. In **Psalms 90:12**,
David wrote, "Teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom".
I hope this program brings you to a conciousness to slow down and enjoy every moment
and live a full filled life.
